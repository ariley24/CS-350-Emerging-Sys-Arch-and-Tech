# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-and-Tech  

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to design a program for a thermostat. The program utilizes a sensor on the TI CC3220SF-LAUNCHXL microcontroller to read the room temperature. The program utilizes interrupts, timers, I2C, and UART to read the temperature in a predetermined interval, set the desired temperature using buttons on the board, and turning the heat on or off depending on how the ambient heat compares to the set temperature. The program then displays the current temperature, set temperature, heat status (on or off) and time the program has been running (in seconds) in the console.  

### What did you do particularly well?  
One thing I feel I did particularly well for this project was ensure that it meets all the functionality requirements. Another thing I feel I did well was comment my code to make it easy to understand and maintain.  

### Where could you improve?  
I feel I could improve my making my code more concise. As I am still learning various coding languages and syntax, and am confident that with more practice and experience I will be able to improve readability and maintainability.  

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?  
This course was my first experience with CCS as well as with programming a MCU. It also allowed my to continue to practice coding in C. All of this experience will benefit me as a software engineer in the future.  

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?  
This project relied heavily on interrputing specifications and functionality and implimenting them into the code. It was also important to keep the code organized and sructured correctly to ensure desired functionality as well as assist in troubleshooting. All of these skills will be important to continue to use in other projects and course work.  

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I worked to make the code as clear and concise as possible. I heavily commented the code to make it easier to understand it's functionality and what the purpose of each line is. The code is designed in a way that additional tasks and functionality could be added easily, and current tasks/functions could be altered to acheive different functionality, if desired.
